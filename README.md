# Estimate-the-value-of-PI
This program estimates the value of the constant PI, based on some random numbers generated from 0-1
Random floating point numbers are generated from 0 - 1
for every cycle of loop, a point on the plane of a unit circle is generated.
This values are used to calculate the Constant PI
